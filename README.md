# CoronaConnection
This app is a modern-day solution for our social-dstanced reality during the Coronavirus pandemic. Communities need to be able to connect with one another without meeting in person. This app combines real-time news with a realtime chat application to help neighbors connect.

Once users are authenticated, they are able to log into the chat application, which will prompt them for their nickname and zipcode. Users will then be grouped by zipcode to connect directly with one another in a hyperlocal chatroom.

(DISCPLAIMER: This app should not be used for emergency situations. In case of emergency, please call 911.)
